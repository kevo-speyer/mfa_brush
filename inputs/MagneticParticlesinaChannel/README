* Starting configuration of two liquids in a channel.
* No polymers. 
* The liquid is composed of particles of type 3 and type 4.
* Starting point for a coarse-grained model of magnetic nano-particles in a microfluidic channel. 
* Modeling an external magnetic field. Two Cases: magnetic simple model, spiral coil.
* Expecting a third case of cylindrical magnets of different shapes.
