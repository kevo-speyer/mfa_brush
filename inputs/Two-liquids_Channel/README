* Starting configuration of two liquids in a channel.
* No polymers. 
* The liquid is composed of particles of type 3 and type 4.
* Starting point for a coarse-grained model of magnetic nano-particles in a microfluidic channel. 
* Addition of some external force, modeling an external magnetic field is expected.:w
